Community Detection in Attributed Heterogeneous Information Networks

This project is inspired by the paper "Semi-supervised Clustering in Attributed Heterogeneous Information Networks". 
The goal is to detect communities in a heterogeneous information network. The
network consists of user terminals and Wi-Fi access points. 
I implemented SCHAIN-NL algorithm to take user attributes (user app usage pattern) 
and the topology of network into account do the community detection. 
The system is running on real dataset, which contains over 20K users in Beijing, China.
